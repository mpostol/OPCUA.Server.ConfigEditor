# OPC UA Server Data Binding and Configuration Editor ASMD plug-in

Address Space Model Designer Plug-in to be used as the OPC UA Server data binding and configuration external editor.

The software is a part of the `CommServer` software family. It was written by CAS Lodz Poland. `CommServer` is a package of software to manage data transfer. The software implements algorithms and uses technologies that provide smart data transfer over the network. To learn more about `CommServer` software family visit the [software home page][comsvr].

I was the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to move this software to Open Source.

I use [Semantic Versioning][SV] for versioning. For the versions available, see the [releases on this repository][REL]. For your convenience, the versions of the repository, tools, and NuGet packages have been listed in the next subsections.

## Partnership program

I am a researcher and University associate who is passionate about applying knowledge and experience in building a Machine to Machine (M2M) meaningful interoperability based on OPC UA. Let's build it with you and for you. To join our effort and create an organizational context I have launched an open-access **Object-Oriented Internet Partnership Program**. Hence, maintenance of this repository and further development of the OPC UA Information Model Domain-Specific Language will be carried out under a broader concept described in the following article
